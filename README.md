# FIFA 2022 Predictor
FIFA World Cup 2022 winner predictor for final proyect on Machine Learning class

## Problem to solve
Discover, based on previous data from matches between national teams, which team is going to win the 2022 World Cup. In principle, it seeks to predict the winner of each match that takes place from the group stage and the knockout stage until reaching the final and thus obtain the winner of the championship. If possible in terms of data and time, the prediction of the result (in goals) of each match could also be added.

## Value proposal
A World Cup match predictor can be beneficial for the participating teams because in this way they can be warned against teams that have shown better performance in the past. Teams can also benefit from knowing where they could improve in the future. Thanks to the dataset's split between attacking and defending strength, players in certain positions could also deduce their ability to buff.
On the other hand, the predictor can be sold to people who bet on the outcome of matches. This can give you a huge advantage in these decisions.
Also, it's a fun project :D

## Dataset to use
[Fulvo Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brenda89/fifa-world-cup-2022)

The dataset has 25 columns in total and provides information on all international matches played between national teams starting in the 1990s. Some of the most outstanding columns in the dataset are home_team(home team), away_team(away team). The dataset also has general scores awarded by FIFA that provide data on the team in general, defense and attack.
Under our proposal, we will seek to predict the home_team_result column about the different matches scheduled in the 2022 World Cup.
